One project I’m especially proud of is a respiratory monitor I developed as part of my biomedical engineering coursework. The goal was to create a wearable band to detect pauses in breathing by monitoring changes in rib diameter using a flex sensor, specifically to alert patients with sleep apnea.
I designed the circuit to interface with the flex sensor, and used Schmitt triggers to convert the analog ADC output into a clean rectangular pulse signal. This step was crucial and the Schmitt trigger helped eliminate noise and allowed us to generate distinct digital transitions that can be correlated to each inhale and exhale.
From there, the C++ software detected rising edges in the pulse signal, representing individual breaths. By measuring the time between these edges, the system could identify abnormal pauses that might indicate a dangerous pause in breathing- a common problem for patients with sleep apnea. When a pause was detected, the microcontroller triggered haptic motors to create a buzzing sensation, gently alerting the patient.
I also drafted ISO-compliant technical documentation, ensuring the design was clearly communicated with medical device standards in mind. This project combined hands-on circuit design, embedded programming, and real-world problem-solving in healthcare — all areas I’m passionate about. I was especially proud during our final project demonstration when the sleep apnea band which we had developed from the ground up truly worked to detect breathing patterns.
