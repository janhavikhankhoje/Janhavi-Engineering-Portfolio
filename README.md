Hi! My name is Janhavi and I recently graduated from UT Austin with a degree in Biomedical Engineering. I focused on the instrumentation and imaging track, where I gained hands on experience in hardware and software tools. The main branch introduces me and my background and the other branches explore my projects including a temperature monitor and respiratory monitor. Thanks for stopping by!
